# Tensorflow_2player_pong
A code reimplementation of DeepMind's "Multiagent Cooperation and Competition with Deep Reinforcement Learning" with Tensorflow 

The code is based on [choo8's work](https://github.com/choo8/Tensorflow-DeepMind-Atari-Deep-Q-Learner-2Player.git)+ my tweaks

To run this, you need to install [Xitari2Player](https://github.com/choo8/Xitari2Player) first.
